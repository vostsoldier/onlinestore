MAKE THESE CHANGES!!!
IT IS IN ORDER OF PRIORITY
-
-Make product listing design better/less clunky (Could stack one on one)
-Make it so that when you hover over a product in main, it shows a quick desc (Might interfere with transform animation)
-Consider space and make UI more pleasing to look at
-Fill empty space with something and make bigger font
-Create shopping cart page
